AI Agent Implementation Report

An AI-powered SQL agent was implemented using LangChain integrated with Google Gemini and connected to a MySQL relational database (coffee_shop). The agent was designed to translate natural language questions into valid MySQL queries and return analytical insights based on the stored data.

Key Capabilities of the AI Agent

The AI agent is capable of:

Interpreting natural language questions related to the database

Automatically generating correct MySQL-compatible SQL queries

Executing queries on the relational database

Returning structured and human-readable analytical results

The agent strictly operates within the scope of the database and does not rely on external knowledge sources.
